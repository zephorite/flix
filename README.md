### Notes
- 2FAuthentication from github created issues with committing the project, github account just needed to be signed out and signed back in on Xcode.

- Launchscreen on any simulator with a notch doesn't display the launch screen image when launched in landscape mode, could not test on a phone with a notch to see if issue is only on the simulator.
